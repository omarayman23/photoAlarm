# photoAlarm
works just like a regular alarm with a twist, for u to stop the alarm u need to take a picture or a 5 second audio recording of yourself to ensure you are up and do not go back to sleep

trial 2
- camera and timer works
- colors work

TO FIX
- need to remember log-ins
- sound for the alarm
- dismiss the alarm when photo is captured

trial 3
- camera and microphone works
- new log in page that REQUIRES user enters an email (SOMETHING@domain.com)
- alarm works
- name tags for alarms
